A spitting image of me
Except for a heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prison of sleep
Deepened now
A rabbit hole never to be found
Again
Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone
Feelings, raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
But dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in
As I go down the drain
I appear missing now
I go missing,
No longer exist
One day I hope
I'm someone you'd met
Shock me awake
Tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper I sleep
Further down
A rabbit hole never to be found
It's only falling in love
Because you hit the ground
Dancing on wire both ends are on fire
Cut…  40
